> Let's express ourselves in the most unique way of developers, through code!

## What

A code editor interface where you can get creative, express yourself, write something and share.

* Pick your theme.
* Choose your preferred language.
* Write some lines of code.
* Copy or capture your snippet.
* Or [commit](https://github.com/khang-nd/express-code/tree/master/src/snippets) your wonderful snippet to this repository.
* To **Share**.

## Why

* To implement an original idea of mine - at least it was before I was aware of [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/).
* To learn [Svelt](https://svelte.dev/) - yes, like many other fellow devs, we learn by building things.
